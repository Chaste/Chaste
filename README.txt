========= WELCOME TO CHASTE ===========

The files you have downloaded contain the source code for all
Chaste functionality.  Chaste makes use of a variety of external
libraries and packages that need to be installed on your machine.  The
file docs/INSTALLATION.txt provides a comprehensive guide on how to
install these external tools.

Chaste is distributed as open source software under the 3-clause BSD
licence.  For full details see the file docs/Copying.pdf.
Chaste uses various third party libraries which have their own
licences.  For details of these licences and the impact they may have
on your use of Chaste please see docs/Licences.html.

Chaste includes a complete test suite covering all the source
code. The easiest way to use existing source codes is to create a test
file which can call upon any of the source files.  The Chaste build
system can build this file for you and handle all of the dependencies
and library calls.

We suggest you use the projects directory in this manner to store your
own source and test files if you do not wish to modify the Chaste
source code. For more information, see:

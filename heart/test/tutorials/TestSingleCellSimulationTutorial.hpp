 * == Introduction ==
 *
 * In this tutorial we run a single cell simulation,
 * showing:
 *  * how to load a cardiac cell (using CVODE - best solver to use for single cell simulations).
 *  * how to define the stimulus (using the default from CellML).
 *  * run the model to steady state using the {{{SteadyStateRunner}}}.
 *  * solve the model for the number of paces of interest.
 *  * Write to voltage data to a file.
 *  * Use {{{CellProperties}}} to output information such as APD and upstroke velocity.
 *
 *
 *
 * The first thing to do is to include the headers.

         * == Numerical Considerations ==
         *
         * Cardiac cell models can be pretty tricky to deal with, as they are very stiff and sometimes full
         * of singularities.
         *
         * One of the first things you want to ensure is that the maximum timestep CVODE can take is less
         * than or equal to the duration of the stimulus. Otherwise CVODE could evaluate the right-hand side
         * before and after the stimulus, and never see it (giving you a cell that never does anything).
         * This can be done using something like:
         *
         * {{{double max_timestep = p_regular_stim->GetDuration();}}}
         *
         * instead of the declaration of `max_timestep` below. In this tutorial we want an answer that is
         * refined in time to give an accurate upstroke velocity. So we make the maximum timestep even
         * smaller, to match the printing timestep. A rough rule of thumb would be to use the smaller of
         * stimulus duration and printing time step as your CVODE maximum timestep. But note CVODE will still
         * give sensible answers if printing timestep is less than maximum timestep, it might just decide
         * to interpolate the output instead of evaluate it directly, if it thinks it will be
         * accurate enough to meet your tolerances.
         *
         *
         * A common error from CVODE is '''TOO_MUCH_WORK''', this means CVODE tried to exceed the maximum number of
         * internal time steps it is allowed to do. You can try using the method `SetMaxSteps` to change
         * the default (500) to a larger value, with a command like:
         *
         * {{{p_model->SetMaxSteps(1e5);}}}
         *
         * We have found that 1e5 should be enough for a single pace of all models we've tried so far,
         * but if you were running for a long time (e.g. 1000 paces in one Solve call) you would need to increase this.
         *
         * Another common error from CVODE is:
         * '''the error test failed repeatedly or with |h| = hmin.'''
         *
         * Since we don't change hmin (and it defaults to a very small value), this generally means the
         * ODE system has got to a situation where refining the timestep is not helping the convergence.
         *
         * This generally indicates that you are hitting some sort of singularity, or divide by zero, in
         * the model. Unfortunately cardiac models are full of these, they can sometimes be manually edited out
         * by changing the cellML file, for instance using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule L'Hopital's rule].
         *
         * In this case, one other thing you can try is to change the absolute and relative
         * tolerances of the CVODE solver, the default being (1e-5,1e-7), although it isn't clear whether
         * refining sometimes makes things worse for models with singularities, 
         * as CVODE goes to look for trouble in areas with steep gradients.
         * 
         * For this particular test, we are going to specify quite strict tolerances, so that the test gets the same results
         * on different versions of CVODE and different compilers.

         * By default we use an analytic Jacobian for CVODE cells (where available - see [wiki:ChasteGuides/CodeGenerationFromCellML]
         * for instructions on how to provide one using Maple). In some cases (the Hund-Rudy model particularly being one) the
         * analytic Jacobian contains effectively divide-by-zero entries, even at resting potential. If you observe
         * CVODE errors when trying to run simulations, it can be worth switching off the analytic Jacobian and resorting
         * to a numerical approximation (as happens by default if no analytic Jacobian is available). This can be done with the
         * following command:

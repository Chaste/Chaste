/* 
 * ## How to run a Bidomain simulation and its equivalent Monodomain reduction
 *
 * ### Introduction
 *
 * In this tutorial we show how Chaste is used to run a standard mono and a standard bidomain simulation.
 * With equivalent parameters so that the bidomain could be reduced to the monodomain case.
 *
 * The bulk of this tutorial is the same as the tutorial [Running Bidomain Simulations](docs/user-tutorials/runningbidomainsimulations), 
 * so for details of the following code block see that page.

/* == Notes ==
 *
 * * Making a checkpoint does add a significant overhead at present, in particular because the mesh is
 *   written out to disk at each checkpoint. This is to ensure that each checkpoint directory contains everything
 *   needed to resume the simulation. The mesh written out will be in permuted form if it was
 *   partitioned for a parallel simulation.
 * * To make this process slightly more efficient, Chaste will copy the original mesh files if the mesh was loaded
 *   from disk and hasn't been modified (e.g. by permuting).  Because of this, if you modify the mesh in memory,
 *   e.g. by setting element attributes in [UserTutorials/BidomainWithBath bidomain-with-bath simulations], then
 *   you need to inform Chaste by calling `mesh.SetMeshHasChangedSinceLoading()`, so your modifications aren't lost.
 * * Meshes written in checkpoints use a binary form of the !Triangle/Tetgen mesh format. This makes checkpoints
 *   significantly smaller but will cause portability problems if checkpoints are moved between little-endian systems
 *   (e.g. x86) and big-endian systems (e.g. PowerPC).
 * * Checkpoints may be resumed on any number of processes â€” you are not restricted to the number on which it was
 *   saved. However, the mesh will not be re-partitioned if loaded on a different number of processes, so the parallel
 *   efficiency of the simulation may be significantly reduced in this case.
 * * Resuming a checkpoint will attempt to extend the original results HDF5 file if it exists (specified by
 *   `HeartConfig::SetOutputDirectory` and `HeartConfig::SetOutputFilenamePrefix`), so that the file contains the complete
 *   simulation results. If this file does not exist a new file will be created containing just the results from the
 *   resume time.
 *
 * * When checkpointing, the `progress_status.txt` file only reports the percentage of time to
 *   go until the ''next'' checkpoint, not until the end of the simulation.  This makes it slightly less
 *   useful; however, the presence of the checkpoint directories (`1ms`, `2ms`, etc.) provides overall
 *   progress information instead.
 * * On older versions of Boost (before 1.37) there are some restrictions on what may be successfully checkpointed.
 *   Firstly, checkpointing a simulation that uses a dynamically loaded cell model is impossible.
 *   Secondly, if you are using a "non-standard" cell model, i.e. one that is hard-coded but not one of those available
 *   via the XML configuration file, then you may get an error "terminate called after throwing an instance of
 *   'boost::archive::archive_exception' what():  unregistered class".  To resolve this you unfortunately have to
 *   include the header for the relevant cell model in `CardiacSimulationArchiver.cpp`; after the inclusion of
 *   `HeartConfigRelatedCellFactory.hpp` is a sensible location.
 * * Related to the above point, on all Boost versions if you are saving and loading a simulation in different
 *   source or test files, ensure that you have the same list of includes in both cases, or the serialization code
 *   may not know about all classes when loading, and give the "unregistered class" error.

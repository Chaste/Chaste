     *   - Cell model uses amps per unit capacitance.  Often in this case the units used
     *     for the cell capacitance don't make sense (e.g. uF/cm^2 is used, and dV/dt=I/C_m).
     *     Hence we suggest examining the equation for dV/dt given in the model to determine
     *     what the cell model really considers the value for C_m to be, and scaling by
     *     Chaste's C_m / cell model C_m (the latter implicitly being dimensionless).
     *   - Cell model uses amps.  In this case you need to divide by an estimate of the cell
     *     surface area.  Assuming the model represents a single cell, and gives C_m in farads,
     *     then scaling by Chaste's C_m / model C_m seems reasonable.  If the 'cell model'
     *     doesn't actually represent a single whole cell, then you'll have to be more careful.
     * In both cases additional scaling may be required to obtain correct units once the
     * dimensions have been sorted out.
     *
     * Chaste's value for C_m can be obtained from HeartConfig::Instance()->GetCapacitance()
     * and is measured in uF/cm^2.
     *
     * For state-variable interpolation (SVI) we need to interpolate state variables at nodes onto
     * quadrature points and then pass these into this method (see optional argument). Otherwise
     * for ionic-current interpolation (ICI) we use the cell's internal state variables.

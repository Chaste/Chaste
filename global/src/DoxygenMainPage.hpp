 * physiology. Current functionality includes tissue and cell level electrophysiology, discrete tissue modelling,
 * and soft tissue modelling. The package is being developed by a team mainly based in the Computational Biology
 * Group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, and development draws on expertise from
 * software engineering, high performance computing, mathematical modelling and scientific computing.

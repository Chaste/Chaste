/**
 * A class for solving a one-dimensional acoustic impedance problem on a branched 1D tree.
 *
 * This is perhaps the simplest possible impedance calculation that can be performed on an
 * airway tree. Airway wall compliance, alveolar gas shunting and many other effects are neglected.
 *
 * The impedance of a single airway is given by
 *
 * Z = R + i*I*omega
 *
 * with R & I calculated assuming Pouseilleâ€™s flow and omega is the angular frequency.
 * The impedance of an acinus is given by
 *
 * Z = -i*E/omega
 *
 * where E is the elastance of the acinus.

= Running a simulation with multiple-channel drug action =

=== Getting the data ===

Download and save the attached file [attachment:DrugAction.tgz DrugAction.tgz].
Either use an Archive Manager to extract the content to disk or save it and then unpack it with
{{{
#!sh
tar xvfz  DrugAction.tgz
}}}

=== Tagging conductances in a CellML file ===

Before performing drug action simulations with the executable, your CellML file must have the relevant ion-channel conductances tagged.

i.e. add a cmeta tag to the relevant variable:
{{{
#!xml
<variable units="milliS_per_cm2" name="g_Kmax" public_interface="out" initial_value="0.282" cmeta:id="IKr_conductance"/>
}}}

and then add the following RDF metadata description. This tells Chaste to convert the model leaving the parameter modifiable, and also tells Chaste what name to use - the name in the `<bqbiol:is>` tag is the one to use in the XML parameter file later. It MUST end in {{{_conductance}}} (to ensure that only conductances are modified!).
{{{     
#!xml
<rdf:Description rdf:about="#IKr_conductance">
  <modifiable-parameter xmlns="https://chaste.comlab.ox.ac.uk/cellml/ns/pycml#">yes</modifiable-parameter>
  <bqbiol:is rdf:resource="https://chaste.comlab.ox.ac.uk/cellml/ns/oxford-metadata#membrane_rapid_delayed_rectifier_potassium_current_conductance"/>
</rdf:Description>
}}}

=== Understanding the XML parameters file ===

This tutorial is based upon [wiki:UserTutorials/CardiacExecutable/Propagation1d 1D Propagation tutorial].

Open `ChasteParameters.xml` (it is sensible to do this in a web-browser or XML editor in order to get syntax highlighting). The file has been altered to add the following sections:
 * physiological parameters: 
   * The following xml has been added, this specifies a drug concentration and IC50 values for (in this case) two ion-channels. You can use any units, but they need to be self-consistent (concentration in same units as IC50 values), if not specified the dose-response curve hill coefficient defaults to 1.
{{{
#!xml
<!-- Parameters for drug action model -->
<ApplyDrug concentration="3">
    <!-- Current names should match those in the Oxford metadata -->
    <IC50 current="membrane_fast_sodium_current" hill="1.0">16000</IC50>
    
    <!-- Add action on a second channel -->
    <!-- Hill coefficient defaults to 1.0 -->
    <IC50 current="membrane_rapid_delayed_rectifier_potassium_current">5</IC50>
</ApplyDrug>
}}}
   * Here we named the currents which are to have their conductances modified - i.e. the name of the conductance tags WITHOUT {{{_conductance}}} on the end.
 * post-processing:
   * The following XML has been added:
{{{
#!xml
<!-- Postprocessing parameters -->
<PostProcessing>            
    <!-- Extract nodal time trace at node 200 --> 
    <TimeTraceAtNode node_number="200"/>
</PostProcessing>
}}}
As we wish to record an action potential for comparing control and drug action.

=== Running the simulation ===

Change directory to {{{DrugAction}}}
{{{
#!sh
cd DrugAction
}}}

In this folder you will find the following files:
 * `ChasteParameters.xml` -- this file describes the simulation, and can be used to override the [//docs/HeartConfigDefaults_8hpp.html default parameter values] (in releases of the executable up to and including version 2.0, the default parameters were read in from another xml file, `ChasteDefaults.xml`).
 * `ChasteParameters_2_3.xsd` -- XML schema for input validation (in general never has to be altered or touched).

Run the simulation by doing
{{{
<path_to_chaste>/Chaste.sh ChasteParameters.xml
}}}

A folder called {{{testoutput}}} will appear once the simulation has finished.

=== Visualising the results ===

Move into the newly created output folder
{{{
#!sh
cd testoutput/ChasteResults
}}}

In this folder you will find the following files and folders:
 * `progress_status.txt`  -- this file can be viewed whilst the simulation is running to gauge how long it will take
 * `DrugActionResults.h5` -- the output of the simulation, in HDF5 format
 * `output` (folder) -- contains the following files:
   * `DrugActionResults_mesh.pts` -- output converted into meshalyzer format
   * `DrugActionResults_mesh.cnnx` -- output converted into meshalyzer format
   * `DrugActionResults_V.dat` -- output converted into meshalyzer format
   * `NodalTraces_V.dat` -- voltage trace at node 200.
   
Move now into the Meshalyzer-compatible output folder 
{{{
#!sh
cd output
}}}
Launch Meshalyzer with
{{{
<path_to_meshalyzer>/meshalyzer DrugActionResults_mesh
}}}
and visualise the results by loading the `DrugActionResults_V.dat` file.

Or use gnuplot to look at the voltage trace
{{{
gnuplot
> plot "NodalTraces_V.dat"
}}}

You should then change the drug concentration to zero:
{{{
#!xml
<!-- Parameters for drug action model -->
<ApplyDrug concentration="0">
    <!-- Current names should match those in the Oxford metadata -->
    <IC50 current="membrane_fast_sodium_current" hill="1.0">16000</IC50>
    
    <!-- Add action on a second channel -->
    <!-- Hill coefficient defaults to 1.0 -->
    <IC50 current="membrane_rapid_delayed_rectifier_potassium_current">5</IC50>
</ApplyDrug>
}}}
then re-run the simulation and compare results. You should observe the following:

# Using CellML with (Cardiac) Chaste

There is a companion tool to Chaste, named PyCml, which can generate Chaste-compatible C++ code from cardiac ionic cell models described in CellML.
This allows Chaste to make use of any such model.
It also applies some optimisations to improve the speed of simulations.

Full documentation can be found on the Chaste wiki at:
https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ChasteGuides/CodeGenerationFromCellML

Static versions of the guide accompanying Chaste releases are also available.
See:

for release 2019.1.

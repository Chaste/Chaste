/**
 * Abstract OdeSystem class for Cvode systems (N_Vector instead of std::vector)
 *
 * Sets up variables and functions for a general CVODE system, and uses an inbuilt CVODE solver.
 *
 * N.B. The CvodeAdaptor solver is not used by AbstractCvodeSystems, it is only used to translate when
 * the ODE system uses the normal std::vector<double> state variables.
 * For Chaste developers - this means there is some duplication of code between this class
 * and CvodeAdaptor as both set up and use CVODE to solve systems. If you change one you should
 * probably change both!
 *
 * ODE systems are specified primarily by the EvaluateYDerivatives() method,
 * which calculates the right-hand side of the system.
 *
 * You can also specify an EvaluateAnalyticJacobian() method which will
 * allow CVODE to evaluate the Jacobian matrix precisely instead of using
 * multiple calls to  EvaluateYDerivatives() to make an approximation to it.
 * This generally provides extra accuracy and better convergence, and so
 * gives a speed up for a given tolerance. Cardiac action potential
 * model Jacobians are calculated automatically by PyCML (see python/pycml)
 * via Maple for symbolic differentiation.
 *
 * Instances can store their state internally in the mStateVariables vector
 * in our base class AbstractParameterisedSystem (see also
 * GetNumberOfStateVariables(), SetStateVariables() and rGetStateVariables()),
 * although this is not essential - the vector may be empty, in which case
 * AbstractIvpOdeSolver::SolveAndUpdateStateVariable may not be used to
 * solve the system.
 *
 * CVODE systems may also have a vector of parameters, which can be accessed
 * through the GetParameter() and SetParameter() methods of our base class.
 *
 * Information about what the parameters and state variables represent is
 * provided by a subclass of AbstractOdeSystemInformation.  Various wrapper
 * methods (e.g. rGetStateVariableNames()) are provided in our base class to
 * access this information.
 *
 * Also, subclasses may define a condition at which ODE solvers should stop
 * prematurely. For this class CVODE solvers are being used, so
 * CalculateRootFunction() should be used to detect the stopping time.
 *
 * Note that the default tolerances for the solver are set by
 * SetTolerances(), these can make quite a difference to the time it takes
 * to solve the ODE system.
 *
 * Repeated calls to Solve will no longer set up and delete CVODE memory, unless
 * the following method is called:
 *
 * SetForceReset(true) - reset each time Solve() is called
 *
 * default - reset if state variables change, or we ask to solve from a different time than the last solve call finished.
 *
 * SetMinimalReset(true) - ignore changes in state vars and just reset if the time is inconsistent.
 *

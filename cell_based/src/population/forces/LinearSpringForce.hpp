/**
 * A linear spring force law between pairs of neighbouring nodes.
 *
 * Implements the force law employed by Meineke et al (2001) in their off-lattice
 * model of the intestinal crypt (doi:10.1046/j.0960-7722.2001.00216.x).
 *
 * Each pair of neighbouring nodes are assumed to be connected by a linear
 * spring. The force of node \f$i\f$ is given
 * by
 *
 * \f[
 * \mathbf{F}_{i}(t) = \sum_{j} \mu_{i,j} ( || \mathbf{r}_{i,j} || - s_{i,j}(t) ) \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{i,j}.
 * \f]
 *
 * Here \f$\mu_{i,j}\f$ is the spring constant for the spring between nodes
 * \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$, \f$s_{i,j}(t)\f$ is its natural length at time \f$t\f$,
 * \f$\mathbf{r}_{i,j}\f$ is their relative displacement and a hat (\f$\hat{}\f$)
 * denotes a unit vector.
 *
 * Length is scaled by natural length.
 * Time is in hours.

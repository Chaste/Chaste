/**
 * Simple stress-based cell-cycle model.
 *
 * A simple stress-dependent cell-cycle model that inherits from
 * AbstractSimplePhaseBasedCellCycleModel. The duration of G1 phase depends
 * on the local stress, interpreted here as deviation from target
 * volume (or area/length in 2D/1D).
 *
 * This model allows for quiescence imposed by transient periods
 * of high stress, followed by relaxation.
 *
 * Note that in this cell cycle model, quiescence is implemented
 * by extending the G1 phase. If a cell is compressed during G2
 * or S phases then it will still divide, and thus cells whose
 * volumes are smaller than the given threshold may still divide.

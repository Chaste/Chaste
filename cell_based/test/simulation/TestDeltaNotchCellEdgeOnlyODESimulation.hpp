 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * == Introduction ==
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * In this tutorial we show how Chaste can be used to simulate a growing cell monolayer culture
 * into which a simple cell-edge based model of Delta/Notch signalling is incorporated. In this model,
 * each edge of the cell has their own concentration of Delta/Notch and ODE system.
 *
 * This model is based on the development by Collier et al. ("Pattern formation by lateral inhibition with feedback:
 * a mathematical model of delta-notch intercellular signalling", J. Theor. Biol. 183:429-446) and comprises
 * two ODEs to describe the evolution in concentrations of Delta and Notch in each cell. The ODE
 * for Notch includes a reaction term that depends on the mean Delta concentration among neighbouring
 * cells. Thus in this simulation each cell needs to be able to access information about its
 * neighbours. We use the {{{CellData}}} class to facilitate this, and introduce a subclass
 * of {{{OffLatticeSimulation}}} called {{{DeltaNotchOffLatticeSimulation}}} to handle the updating
 * of {{{CellData}}} at each time step as cell neighbours change.
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * == The test ==
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * As in previous tutorials, we begin by including the necessary header files. We have
 * encountered these files already. Recall that often, either {{{CheckpointArchiveTypes.hpp}}}
 * or {{{CellBasedSimulationArchiver.hpp}}} must be included the first Chaste header.

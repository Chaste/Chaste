 *
 * == Introduction ==
 *
 * In the previous cell-based Chaste tutorials, we used existing cell-cycle models to define how cells
 * proliferate. In this tutorial, we show how to create a new cell-cycle model class, and how this
 * can be used in a cell-based simulation.
 *
 * == Including header files ==
 *
 * We begin by including the necessary header files. */

#include "CheckpointArchiveTypes.hpp"

/* The next header includes the Boost shared_ptr smart pointer, and defines some useful
 * macros to save typing when using it. */
#include "SmartPointers.hpp"
/* The next header includes the NEVER_REACHED macro, used in one of the methods below. */
#include "Exception.hpp"

/* The next header defines a base class for simple generation-based cell-cycle models.
 * A cell-cycle model is defined as ''simple'' if the duration of each phase of the cell
 * cycle is determined when the cell-cycle model is created, rather than
 * evaluated on the fly (e.g. by solving a system of ordinary differential
 * equations for the concentrations of key cell cycle proteins), and may
 * depend on the cell type. A simple cell-cycle model is defined as ''generation-based'' if it keeps track of the
 * generation of the corresponding cell, and sets the cell type according
 * to this. Our new cell-cycle model will inherit from this abstract class. */
#include "AbstractSimpleGenerationalCellCycleModel.hpp"

/* The remaining header files define classes that will be used in the cell-based
 * simulation test. We have encountered each of these header files in previous cell-based Chaste
 * tutorials, except for {{{CheckReadyToDivideAndPhaseIsUpdated}}}, which defines a helper
 * class for testing a cell-cycle model. */

 * == Defining the cell-cycle model class ==
 *
 * As an example, let us consider a cell-cycle model in which the durations
 * of S, G2 and M phases are fixed, but the duration of G1 phase is an exponential
 * random variable with rate parameter 位. This rate parameter is a constant, dependent on cell type, whose value is
 * chosen such that the mean of the distribution, 1/位, equals the mean
 * G1 duration as defined in the {{{AbstractCellCycleModel}}} class. We will also assume that
 * cells divide a certain number of generations before becoming differentiated. To implement this model we define a new cell-cycle model, {{{MyCellCycleModel}}},
 * which inherits from {{{AbstractSimpleGenerationalCellCycleModel}}} and
 * overrides the {{{SetG1Duration()}}} method.
 *
 * Note that usually this code would be separated out into a separate declaration in
 * a .hpp file and definition in a .cpp file.

     * model does not need to know the spatial dimension, so if we were to call
     * {{{SetDimension()}}} on the new cell-cycle model an exception would be triggered;
     * hence we do not set this member variable. It is also worth noting that in a simulation,

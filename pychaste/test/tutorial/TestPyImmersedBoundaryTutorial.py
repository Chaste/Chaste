## ## Introduction
## This tutorial is a demonstration of the immersed boundary method, a technique
## for simulating fluid-structure interactions. We can use the immersed boundary
## method to simulate a cell as a structure with its outer **boundary immersed**
## in a fluid. There is a two-way coupling between the fluid and the structure:
## the flow of the fluid exerts a force on the structure, and the structure
## influences the flow of the fluid.
##
## In this tutorial, we demonstrate:
## 1. Building single-cell immersed boundary capable simulations.
## 2. Building multi-cellular immersed boundary simulations.
## 3. Adding and manipulating immersed boundary fluid sources.

class TestPyImmersedBoundaryTutorial(AbstractCellBasedTestSuite):

    ## ### 1. Simple Immersed Boundary Simulations
    ## We begin by exploring simulations containing a single cell. This will
    ## familiarise you with how to generate immersed boundary cells, the steps
    ## involved in setting up an immersed boundary simulation, and the options
    ## available for controlling how the cells are generated and behave.
    ##

    ## Immersed boundary simulations operate over a square domain, with `x` and `y`
    ## coordinates lying in the range `0` to `1`. The domain wraps on both axes -
    ## this means that if a cell moves off the right hand edge of the domain,
    ## the segment will appear on the left hand side. This is not purely visual;
    ## forces are also transmitted across these boundaries.
    ##

    ## **Tip** Make sure all your coordinates are between `0` and `1`.

    def test_simple_immersed_boundary_simulation(self):

        ## Setup the simulation environment in the notebook

        # JUPYTER_SETUP

        ## Next, we define the necessary geometry by generating a mesh to
        ## contain a single cell.

        gen = ImmersedBoundaryPalisadeMeshGenerator(1, 128, 0.1, 2.0, 0.0, False)
        mesh = gen.GetMesh()

        ## The first line of code defines an `ImmersedBoundaryPalisadeMeshGenerator`
        ## called `gen`. The 3rd parameter controls the exponent of the superellipse(`0.1`)
        ## and the 4th parameter controls the aspect ratio of the cell(`2.0`). You can
        ## experiment with modifying these to change the initial shape of the cell.
        ##

        ## The second line of code instructs the mesh generator to generate a mesh.
        ## Checking the type of mesh with `type(mesh)` will show it as
        ## `ImmersedBoundaryMesh_2_2`. The `2_2` suffix denotes that we are using
        ## a 2-dimensional space, and 2-dimensional elements to define the mesh.
        ##

        ## We now set the fluid grid resolution. The following code specifies
        ## that we are using a 64x64 grid to simulate our fluid over.

        mesh.SetNumGridPtsXAndY(64)

        ## Next, we generate the cells. We specify a cell type and cell cycle model.
        ## These can be changed to modify the life cycle of the cells. The
        ## cell generator then constructs the necessary information for each
        ## of the elements in the mesh.

        cell_type = DifferentiatedCellProliferativeType()
        cell_generator = CellsGenerator_UniformCellCycleModel_2()
        cells = cell_generator.GenerateBasicRandom(mesh.GetNumElements(), cell_type)

        ## Finally, we construct the cell population. We then specify whether the
        ## population has active fluid sources or not. For now, we are not
        ## using any fluid sources, so we set this to `False`

        cell_population = ImmersedBoundaryCellPopulation_2(mesh, cells)
        cell_population.SetIfPopulationHasActiveSources(False)

        ## We can make a quick visualization of the cell population

        scene = VtkScene_2()
        scene.SetCellPopulation(cell_population)
        nb_manager = JupyterNotebookManager()
        nb_manager.vtk_show(scene, height=300)

        ## Next, we create an `OffLatticeSimulation` simulator to control the
        ## simulation. Although the fluid is simulated on a lattice (grid),
        ## the nodes/cells are not bound to a lattice.

        simulator = OffLatticeSimulation_2_2(cell_population)
        simulator.SetNumericalMethod(ForwardEulerNumericalMethod_2_2())
        simulator.GetNumericalMethod().SetUseUpdateNodeLocation(True)

        ## As we have an off-lattice simulation, we need a way to model the
        ## fluid. This is handled by the `ImmersedBoundarySimulationModifier`.
        ## Modifiers in Chaste are classes that can be attached to simulations
        ## to perform some additional custom functionality each timestep.
        ## In this case, the modifier is responsible for solving the
        ## Navier-Stokes equations and propagating forces between the nodes and
        ## the fluid.

        ib_modifier = ImmersedBoundarySimulationModifier_2()
        simulator.AddSimulationModifier(ib_modifier)

        ## We must also provide the modifier with a force model to govern
        ## interactions between the nodes forming the cell membrane.
        ## Note that these forces only act between nodes in the same cell;
        ## they do not control interactions between cells.

        membrane_force = ImmersedBoundaryLinearMembraneForce_2()
        membrane_force.SetElementSpringConst(1.0 * 1e7)
        ib_modifier.AddImmersedBoundaryForce(membrane_force)

        ## The `ImmersedBoundaryLinearMembraneForce` models forces between
        ## membrane nodes using linear springs i.e, the force applied is
        ## proportional to the deviation of the distance between nodes
        ## from a rest length. The spring constant(`1.0 * 1e7`) defines how
        ## stiff the cell boundary is.
        ##

        ## **Practice** Experiment with adjusting the spring constant to
        ## change the force behaviour between nodes of the cell boundary.
        ##

        ## Next, we set the simulation properties

        dt = 0.05
        simulator.SetOutputDirectory("Python/TestImmersedBoundary_1")
        simulator.SetDt(dt)
        simulator.SetSamplingTimestepMultiple(4)
        simulator.SetEndTime(1000 * dt)

        ## We can add a modifier to visualize the cell population while the
        ## simulation is in progress

        scene_modifier = JupyterSceneModifier_2(nb_manager)
        scene_modifier.SetVtkScene(scene)
        scene_modifier.SetUpdateFrequency(1000)
        simulator.AddSimulationModifier(scene_modifier)

        ## Finally, to run the simulation we call the `Solve()` method.

        simulator.Solve()

        ## Reset the simulation environment in the notebook

        # JUPYTER_TEARDOWN

    ## ### 2. Adding More Cells

    def test_multicell_immersed_boundary_simulation(self):

        ## #### Multiple Cells

        ## Setup the simulation environment in the notebook

        # JUPYTER_SETUP

        ## We can use the mesh generator to generate multiple cells. The first
        ## parameter of the mesh generator constructor controls the number of
        ## cells.
        ##

        ## **Practice** Try increasing the number of cells by adjusting the
        ## parameter value. A sensible range for this tutorial is 4-10 cells.

        gen = ImmersedBoundaryPalisadeMeshGenerator(5, 128, 0.1, 2.0, 0.0, False)

        ## #### Laminas
        ## In addition to the cells we have seen so far, we can introduce
        ## laminas to the simulation. Laminas are surfaces with reduced
        ## dimensionality. For 3D elements, a lamina is a 2D surface. For the
        ## 2D elements we are currently working with, laminas are lines.
        ## Changing the last parameter of the mesh generator constructor from `False`
        ## to `True` will generate a basal lamina spanning the palisade cells.
        ## Laminas can also interact with the fluid field, and can be made
        ## "leaky" to allow some flow across their boundary. This can be used
        ## to model a permeable boundary.
        ##

        ## **Practice** Try changing the 6th constructor parameter to create a lamina.
        ##

        ## #### Cell Variations
        ## Apart from using the 3rd and 4th constructor parameters to modify
        ## the cell shapes, we can also introduce variation between cells by
        ## modifying the 5th parameter.
        ##

        ## **Practice** Try adjusting the 3rd and 4th constructor parameters to
        ## introduce cell variations.
        ##

        ## Next, we generate the mesh and set the fluid grid resolution

        mesh = gen.GetMesh()
        mesh.SetNumGridPtsXAndY(64)

        ## Below, we generate the cells

        cell_type = DifferentiatedCellProliferativeType()
        cell_generator = CellsGenerator_UniformCellCycleModel_2()
        cells = cell_generator.GenerateBasicRandom(mesh.GetNumElements(), cell_type)

        ## Then we set up the cell population with no active fluid sources

        cell_population = ImmersedBoundaryCellPopulation_2(mesh, cells)
        cell_population.SetIfPopulationHasActiveSources(False)

        ## We can visualize the cell population below

        scene = VtkScene_2()
        scene.SetCellPopulation(cell_population)
        nb_manager = JupyterNotebookManager()
        nb_manager.vtk_show(scene, height=300)

        ## Now we create a simulator to manage the simulation

        simulator = OffLatticeSimulation_2_2(cell_population)
        simulator.SetNumericalMethod(ForwardEulerNumericalMethod_2_2())
        simulator.GetNumericalMethod().SetUseUpdateNodeLocation(True)

        ## We add an immersed boundary simulation modifier to the simulator

        ib_modifier = ImmersedBoundarySimulationModifier_2()
        simulator.AddSimulationModifier(ib_modifier)

        ## We then add a force law to the simulation modifier to model the
        ## behaviour of the cell membrane

        membrane_force = ImmersedBoundaryLinearMembraneForce_2()
        membrane_force.SetElementSpringConst(1.0 * 1e7)
        ib_modifier.AddImmersedBoundaryForce(membrane_force)

        ## #### Inter-cellular Interactions
        ## So far, we have encountered forces that act to maintain the shape
        ## of the cell membrane. We can also introduce an inter-cellular
        ## force law using `ImmersedBoundaryLinearInteractionForce`.
        ## This has a `SetSpringConst` method instead of a `SetElementSpringConst`
        ## method. It also has a `SetRestLength` method that we can use to
        ## modify the rest length.

        interaction_force = ImmersedBoundaryLinearInteractionForce_2()
        interaction_force.SetSpringConst(1.0 * 1e6)
        ib_modifier.AddImmersedBoundaryForce(interaction_force)

        ## Next, we set the simulation properties

        dt = 0.05
        simulator.SetOutputDirectory("Python/TestImmersedBoundary_2")
        simulator.SetDt(dt)
        simulator.SetSamplingTimestepMultiple(4)
        simulator.SetEndTime(1000 * dt)

        ## Finally, we run the simulation

        simulator.Solve()

        ## We can visualize the end state of the cell population

        nb_manager.vtk_show(scene, height=300)

        ## Reset the simulation environment in the notebook

        # JUPYTER_TEARDOWN

    ## ### 3. Adding Fluid Sources
    ## Now that we are familiar with how to generate the cells, we will
    ## introduce fluid sources.

    def test_fluid_source_immersed_boundary_simulation(self):

        ## #### Adding a Fluid Source

        ## Setup the simulation environment in the notebook

        # JUPYTER_SETUP

        ## We begin by constructing a fluid source object:

        source = FluidSource_2(0, 0.5, 0.7)

        ## This constructs a `FluidSource` object in 2 dimensions. The first
        ## parameter supplies the index of the fluid source. Each source we
        ## create must have a unique index. The next two parameters are the
        ## `x` and `y` coordinates of the source. Fluid sources in Chaste are
        ## point-like, that is to say they do not have any area/volume.
        ##
        ## Having created the fluid source, we set its strength:

        source.SetStrength(0.012)

        ## Next, we create the mesh

        gen = ImmersedBoundaryPalisadeMeshGenerator(5, 128, 0.1, 2.0, 0.0, False)
        mesh = gen.GetMesh()
        mesh.SetNumGridPtsXAndY(64)

        ## We must associate the source with an element in the simulation
        ## so that the simulation is aware of the source.

        mesh.GetElement(0).SetFluidSource(source)

        ## We now generate the cells

        cell_type = DifferentiatedCellProliferativeType()
        cell_generator = CellsGenerator_UniformCellCycleModel_2()
        cells = cell_generator.GenerateBasicRandom(mesh.GetNumElements(), cell_type)

        ## Then we set up the cell population

        cell_population = ImmersedBoundaryCellPopulation_2(mesh, cells)

        ## Finally, we must tell the cell population that fluid sources are present.

        cell_population.SetIfPopulationHasActiveSources(True)

        ## #### Varying the Source Location and Strength
        ## **Practice** You can experiment with the source location. Try moving it
        ## closer to and further away from the cells.
        ##

        ## **Practice** Try modifying the source strength to see what impact this
        ## has on the cell shapes.
        ##

        ## Below, we visualize the cell population

        scene = VtkScene_2()
        scene.SetCellPopulation(cell_population)
        nb_manager = JupyterNotebookManager()
        nb_manager.vtk_show(scene, height=300)

        ## Create a simulator to manage the simulation

        simulator = OffLatticeSimulation_2_2(cell_population)
        simulator.SetNumericalMethod(ForwardEulerNumericalMethod_2_2())
        simulator.GetNumericalMethod().SetUseUpdateNodeLocation(True)

        ## Add an immersed boundary simulation modifier

        ib_modifier = ImmersedBoundarySimulationModifier_2()
        simulator.AddSimulationModifier(ib_modifier)

        ## #### Fluid-Cell Interaction
        ## **Practice** Try modifying the spring constant of the
        ## `ImmersedBoundaryLinearMembraneForce` to see how this changes the
        ## effect of the fluid source on the cells.

        membrane_force = ImmersedBoundaryLinearMembraneForce_2()
        membrane_force.SetElementSpringConst(1.0 * 1e7)
        ib_modifier.AddImmersedBoundaryForce(membrane_force)

        ## Add an inter-cellular force law

        interaction_force = ImmersedBoundaryLinearInteractionForce_2()
        interaction_force.SetSpringConst(1.0 * 1e6)
        ib_modifier.AddImmersedBoundaryForce(interaction_force)

        ## #### Adding More Sources
        ## **Practice** Try adding a second fluid source. You will need to
        ## use a unique index, and attach it to a different element as
        ## each element can only manage a single fluid source.
        ##

        ## Next, we set the simulation properties

        dt = 0.05
        simulator.SetOutputDirectory("Python/TestImmersedBoundary_3")
        simulator.SetDt(dt)
        simulator.SetSamplingTimestepMultiple(4)
        simulator.SetEndTime(300 * dt)

        ## Finally, we run the simulation

        simulator.Solve()

        ## Then we visualize the end state

        nb_manager.vtk_show(scene, height=300)

        ## Reset the simulation environment in the notebook
        # JUPYTER_TEARDOWN

        ## #### Further Exercises
        ## * Try integrating a different cell cycle model to introduce cell
        ##   division. See how the presence of a fluid source impacts the
        ##   structure that is formed.
        ## * Use one of the cell writers to collect some statistics

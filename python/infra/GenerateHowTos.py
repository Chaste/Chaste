As well as ensuring that Chaste functions as expected, the many Chaste tests can be effective for learning how to use Chaste.
There are often aspects of Chaste's capabilities that do not warrant a full user tutorial, but are still worth noting.
Equally, users often ask "how do I do...", and in many cases there is already a test that does something similar and can be used as a basis.

This page contains a (probably partial) index of links to useful code.
Some of the links are to code in tutorials.
The others are links to test code.
For the latter, note that since tests are written primarily for checking functionality, they are not commented to the same degree as user tutorials.
Nevertheless, they should be reasonably readable and useful.

Note that this page is generated automatically based on tags in the Chaste code.
Do not edit it manually, as your changes will be overwritten!

## Creating new how-tos

Any C-style block comment found in a test file that looks like the following will be given an entry in the index:

 * HOW_TO_TAG Section/Subsection
 * Short description (ideally one-liner)

The short description may run over multiple lines; it will be considered to end either at the end of the comment, or at a blank comment line, whichever comes first.
This index is automatically updated by a GitHub Actions workflow triggered by any new commit pushed to the `develop` branch.

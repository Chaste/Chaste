This file contains information on how to run Immersed Boundary simulations
using the Chaste user project `ImmersedBoundary`.

The following changes to the Chaste source need to be made:

 (1) A "NEVER_REACHED" needs to be commented out of `OffLatticeSimulation.cpp`
     to allow `ImmersedBoundaryCellPopulation` to be used
 (2) An exception needs to be removed (temporarily) from `NodeAttributes.cpp`
 (3) fftw must be linked by adding it to your hostconfig file

These three changes can be implemented in the following way:

 (1) & (2) "patch -p0 < projects/ImmersedBoundary/ImmersedBoundary.patch"
           from the Chaste directory
 (3) Adding 'fftw3' and 'fftw3_threads' to the `other_libraries` variable in
     your `python/hostconfig/machines/<NAME>.py` file

Finally, before running any simulations, it is strongly advised to first run the
test `TestGenerateFftwWisdom.hpp`.  This will generate two plaintext files in
your CHASTE_TEST_OUTPUT folder that help fftw optimize discrete Fourier
transforms for your hardware.  This test can take a long time (2-6 hours) if
being run from scratch, so if you know that you will not be using arrays larger
than a certain size, you can edit the private member variable `mMaxArraySize`
accordingly.  The default is 4096x4096, and all powers of 2 up to that size will
be generated.

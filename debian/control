Description: general purpose computational biology simulation package
 Chaste (Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment) is a general purpose
 simulation package aimed at multi-scale, computationally demanding problems
 arising in biology and physiology. Current functionality includes tissue and
 cell level electrophysiology, discrete tissue modelling, and soft tissue
 modelling. The package is being developed by a team mainly based in the
 Computational Biology Group at Oxford University Computing Laboratory, and
 development draws on expertise from software engineering, high performance
 computing, mathematical modelling and scientific computing.
